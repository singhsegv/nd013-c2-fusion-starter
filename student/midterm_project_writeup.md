# Writeup: Midterm: 3D Object Detection

### 1. Find 10 examples of vehicles with varying degrees of visibility in the point-cloud

### 2. Try to identify vehicle features that appear stable in most of the inspected examples and describe them

Identify vehicle features that appear as a stable feature on most vehicles (e.g. rear-bumper, tail-lights) and describe them briefly. Also, use the range image viewer from the last example to underpin your findings using the lidar intensity channel.
